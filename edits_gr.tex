 Now the tricky bit for Ch3.: It is too long and the key messages are somewhat obscured beyond the one that you have been pretty comprehensive about thi. There are three options really.
>>>> 1. Disagree with me and leave it as it is (which is fine, it is just my opinion)
>>>> 2. Remove most of the studies leaving only the most interesting ones and move the deleted ones to a supplementary chapter. Leave in CH3 a paragraph that says you are limiting discussion to the key findings, a more extensive review of the other main (list them) centrality measures is provided in supplementary chapter X.
>>>> 3. include a statement that you are deliberately being comprehensive in your assessment and presenting all results but if the reader wants to focus on the core findings they should skip to sections 3.X and 3.Y and the summary in 3.14
>>>> Note: You could almost turn this into a tutorial paper on how to do this for any protein network and that might be a worthwhile activity at some point.
