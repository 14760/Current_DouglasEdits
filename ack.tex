Generation of the summary statistics for the intelligence discovery and education discovery samples was carried out by Dr W. David Hill. Dr Hill performed the LD score regression and calculated genetic correlations between studies. Section~\ref{sec:samples from paper section}. The information in this section is taken the part of a paper being prepared in collaboration with Dr Hill written by him. 


Dr Okbay - provided samples for EA2 and performed the subset analysis.
